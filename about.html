                        This is what you call a motherfucking website, and I did in two hour and with minimal web design experience better then people that were <i>paid</i> by MCPS. Best part? This site only weighes 5 fucking kilobytes compared to the 90 kilobytes of the <a href="https://classroom.mcpsmd.org/">original</a> excluding the images, and needs only 60 lines of CSS compared to the two fucking 1000-line CSS files. Seriously, when your CSS files have as much fucking lines as Minecraft you are doing something fucking wrong, and you guys can't even get the footer color to be consistent with those 1000 fucking lines. Y'all can't even be bothered to update the thing about Outlook login being new even though its over a year old. Of course, I did it with the help of <a href="https://matthewjamestaylor.com/bottom-footer">Matthew James Taylor</a> as  well as a bunch of random help guids, but hey, its the fucking Internet! Idea and information is supposed to flow freely like a fucking cup of beer.

                        And yes, I used Comic Sans because fuck you. This is satire, and please don't expell me (or you may get the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a> and the <a href="https://splc.org/">SPLC</a> on your back). I was inspired by what I see as bad HTML on the original website, and these 'motherfucking websites:
